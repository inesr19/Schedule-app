## Work Day Scheduler

### Description

The purpose of this project was to create a scheduler that displayed each business hour during a given day with possible notes to save. The scheduler uses a moment.js format to update the current date and time.  Each hour has a text-box where the user can add notes and save those notes by clicking on the “save” button. The notes are then saved in the local storage where the user can access them on their computer. The scheduler also keeps track of what hour it is by setting the textarea grey for hours past, red for the present hour, and green for the future hours.
